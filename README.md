# ai-app-generator

Example opensource implementation for reference : https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer acess real-time and  Script logic:
1. Take input from the user on what does he want to build/generate
2. Send the prompt to any one of AI - eg: Chatgpt/gemini/Antropic/Mistral and generate the file structure required to create the application (Use Free API's wherever possible. Gemini has free API)
3. Now, generate each of the file from the generated file structure. Note: Pass  the initial requirements and generated file structure as System context (keep a total maximum file limit as 20 files)
4. The Overall files that are generated, put them in a zip in the current working directory
5. Optionally try to test if the application works. (Not mandatory that it works)    Assignment: 
Summary: Build a Python script that generates applications using GPT/AI

Output: Python script. The script will take the required inputs from the user and then generate the output code as a zip file in the same working directory craete free api use script test that script working or not  use Gemini has free API
